# Tokyo++

OVERVIEW

## Application

The app is made in Java with NetBeans 8.2 and JDK 8.

You can access it in the  [Releases](https://github.com/wesjrock/TokyoPlusPlus/releases) tab (it will require at least Java Runtime Environment 8 to run it).

One of the main functions is the basics operations to alter the server. The user can search, insert, remove and update modalities in the server, always referring to a sport of that modality to maintain consistence.

Another function is a more complex search, as required in the project's specifications: search for "All athletes that participated in three or more distinct matches, with the total number of matches played".

The user can also generate a PDF file with a table of the result.
